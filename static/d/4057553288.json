Litters that received <strong><em>Tonisity Px</em></strong> clearly <strong><em>out-performed</em></strong> those that didn’t, by <strong><em>weaning more pigs</em></strong>, having <strong><em>lower mortality rates</em></strong>. This was a large comparison of nearly 1500 litters and 20,000 pigs, giving the producer <strong><em>high confidence</em></strong> in results.”</p>\n<Link to=\"/testimonials\">Read More Testimonials</Link>","id":"e0e1f7c1-87be-5383-8413-5242f615afcd"}}]}}}
